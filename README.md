# Scikit-Learn_Regression_ML_Models
Regression Models Using Scikit-Learn Package In Python

Disclaimer: This code snippet is developed with an intension for generic use only. I hereby declare that the code was not part of any of my professional development work. Also, no sensitive or confidential data sources are used for this development.

Description: The repository consists of below list of machine learning algorithms for regression problem:

	1. OLS Regression
	2. Lasso Regression
	3. Ridge Regression
	4. ElasticNet Regression
	5. Random Forest
	6. GBM
	7. Xgboost

Note:
1. This scripts perform k-fold cross validation with hyper parameter tuning 
2. User Input Section allows set all model parameters as well as data source specification. Users dont need to edit anything except this    section. This is a fully automated end to end code
3. It is assumed that input data source is a cleaned i.e. free from outlier and missing values
4. Random Sampling is performed based user given test split and only test sample model evaluation metrices are reported

Compatibility: The code is developed and tested on Jupyter and Spyder Notebook using Python 3.7
